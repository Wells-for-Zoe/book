# GPS-Polygons
## Classic Mode
GPS-Polygons are recorded by walking around the area of interest (e.g. restoration site) and taking GPS-Photos, ideally looking inwards, at bends to demarcate the area. Depending on boundary-complexity of the site, less or more photos are sufficient during this process (see example)

As the App can not know when Polygonrecording is finished, the very last step is to select the #polygon-end Option and capture one final photo. ![image](https://github.com/Wells-for-Zoe/book/assets/97762115/8d3d901e-f3b5-4bd2-ae67-45674809dd55)

This triggers to open a form to add additional attributes, in the custom Form for TerraFund for AFR100, the following additional attributes can be added with some marked mandatory. ![image](https://github.com/Wells-for-Zoe/book/assets/97762115/bce20b80-b992-4dd5-8acd-38961eb874bc)
