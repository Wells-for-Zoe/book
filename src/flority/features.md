# Flority Features

## General Information on Collection Logic
Flority data collection is centred around the capture of highly accurate geotagged photos and associated attributes. Therefore, the camera module will only display an image and allow data capture if the geospatial accuracy is below the systems-wide set threshold (e.g. less than 15m). While it may be annoying at times to have to wait few seconds to capture a photo it is the only way to ensure that captured data will be consistent between thousands of users.

Custom forms allow the collection of any additional attributes, comments and surveys if desired. These are usually directly associated and therefore attached to a previously captured GPS-Photo. These forms are co-created by the project administration and the greenhouse.Flority team.

Flority is supposed to be used in the field to collect actual tamper proof ground truth data. 
It will not allow to geotag or upload any previously captured images from your phone Gallery by design.
