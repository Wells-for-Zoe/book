## tags
Tags help planting organizations to categorize images and data in their system. If you use our system to document not only planting activities but also things like community gatherings, site preparation then it can help to use these tags so while it is not mandatory we highly recommend it. Some tags will have Forms connected with it so for example the tag "Disturbance (Fire/Flood...) will have a Form with additional options to describe the situation as default.
