## I don't have a User Account
If you do not have an Account or your Account Details are wrong you should contact your respective Administrator/Superior who can create an Account for you if your organization is already registered in the system. If not reach out to info@flority.app. 
Even if you should not have an account you still have the option to use the App in the most basic variant to capture accurate GPS-Photos which are saved in your phone gallery (any sort of automatic upload to greenhouse. will not be available in this mode, as well as any custom forms which actually make the App powerful).
Should you get logged out occasionally please contact info@flority.app as this is not supposed to happen.
