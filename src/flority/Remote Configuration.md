##  Remote Configuration
Flority App currently has no settings that can be customized in App by the user. This is by design to keep complexity minimal for the end user in the field but give the Project Administrator maximum flexibility while deploying hundreds of citizen science ground truth data collectors. It is technically possible to adjust each and any setting for each user or user group and the following settings can technically be adjusted. 
* Image Quality and Resolution in Megapixels
* Minimum required geospatial accuracy
* available tags
* available forms
* available Menu Options
* daily upload limits
* remote App deactivation
