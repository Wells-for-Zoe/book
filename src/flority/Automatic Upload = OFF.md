## Automatic Upload = OFF:
Deactivating the Automatic Upload can have the following benefits:

* You do not want your Project Administrators to be able to track your live location? Just upload all photos from the field at once in the evening when in a safe place.
* A free Wifi network is available at the end of the field data recording activity and cellular data costs can thereby be saved by deactivating Automatic Upload
* Your phone battery is weak or has a low charge? Deactivating Auto Upload will save battery as no data will be shared via the App.
* With automatic upload it is not possible to review, delete or edit your photos before they are uploaded. Deactivating Automatic Upload gives you access to Gallery Functions.

Deactivating the Automatic Upload however bears the risk that inexperienced users simply forget to submit photos over a long period of time. 

However it allows (optional setting) to access the internal Flority Gallery Functionality where photos can be reviewed, deleted, tags be edited and forms answered.
Any data captured will accumulate on your phone and not be deleted from the internal Flority storage, so if you were to never upload photos but keep capturing photos your storage might eventually run low.
