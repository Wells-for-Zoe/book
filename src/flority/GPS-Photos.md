## GPS-Photos

GPS-Photos are photos with a geolocation tag. While many camera apps can record a geolocation tag, Flority will only allow the user to capture a geotagged photo within a certain accuracy threshold, e.g. 15m, 10m, 5m, etc. 

The camera will be deactivated to avoid having GPS-Photos showing up at the wrong location with with an error of hundreds of meters if not kilometers which is actually one of the reasons the App was invented. 

## Documenting work in a daily photostream

Flority can be used to document daily work in a nursery, at site preparation as well as documenting any planting acitivities. Being able to gather hundreds of photos dispersed throughout a landscape gives a clear indication where work is happening and it can improve the project significantly if images are analyzed by experienced ecologists.
