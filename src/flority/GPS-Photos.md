## GPS-Photos

GPS-Photos are photos with a geolocation tag. While many camera apps can record a geolocation tag Flority will only allow the user to capture a geotagged photo if the accuracy is above a certain threshold, e.g. 15m, 10m, 5m, etc. Otherwise the camera will be deactivated to avoid having GPS-Photos showing up at the wrong location with with an error of hundreds of meters if not kilometers.
