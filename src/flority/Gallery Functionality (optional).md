## Gallery Functionality (optional)
The Gallery within Flority App is only available if Automatic Upload = OFF. Images can be viewn near full screen by touching the double headed arrow for a brief moment. 


### Review and Delete Images
Multiple images can be selected and deleted. This function can help inexperienced users to remove seemingly identical duplicates to avoid clogging the system with multiple near-identical datapoints. Deleting near-identical duplicates, blurry, incomplete or unwanted photos will save data on user-side and is thereby highly recommended.


### Tag Images
Should a user accidentally have used the wrong tag then it is possible on page two of the Flority Gallery to select multiple images and change their tag.


### Edit Forms
Should a comment or a form be associated and attached to an image then the form details can be altered at a later stage should the Automatic Upload be off. This can be helpful in the following scenarios:
* Some form answers can not be given at the specific moment maybe due to a local expert not being on site
* In bad weather conditions it can be helpful to postpone tedious comment writing to a place where there is no rain/wind or strong sunshine

* Optional = White Icon
If all form answers are optional then the Form Icon is white and information can be given but also an image itself could be submitted without any additional attributes given.


* Mandatory = Red Icon
If at least one form answer is mandatory then the form icon is red and Information must be entered before the corresponding image or Polygon can be uploaded or be submitted for upload.

### Confirm and Upload
Last step in the Gallery mode is to confirm the current selection and to confirm for Upload.
