As it can be cumbersome to share your data on other platforms we allow for the creation of a geofence that can then allow the sharing (or at a later stage to download) the geodata of a certain timeframe in a certain area by specific users.

Click this button to create a geofence and follow the instructions.

Make sure to give the geofence a meaningful name, e.g. the corresponding site name in the connected platform (e.g. TerraMatch)

To share data using the geofence:

1. Select the timeframe that contains the data you want to share
   
3. Make sure to highlight (or toggle private) the photos you want to share (private photos can be shared while remaining the attribute and staying _private_ on the connected platform)
   
5. Select the items you want to share - select a site to push the data to and hit Export (here: on TerraMatch)
