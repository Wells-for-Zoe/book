# greenhouse. A powerful tool for Landscape Restoration.

Having used various tools to view tens of thousands of GPS-Photos as datapoints (e.g. Google Earth Pro, our custom map (https://maps.wellsforzoe.org/?zoom=7&lat=-13.3&lng=34) the process of importing data in near real-time was always frustrating and cumbersome. If you capture and upload a GPS-Photo with Flority App it instantly shows up in the Gallery as well as a dot on the map.
Thousands of users can now capture field data to contribute to increase the transparency of Landscape Restoration Projects based on Natural Solutions.
