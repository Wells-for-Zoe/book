## Private GPS-Photos 

You want to keep your photos private - while still being able to share it with platforms supporting this mode (e.g. TerraMatch)?

If a photo was captured in private mode in Flority it will automatically show up as private in greenhouse and you will see the icon change. If you want to disable the private mode you can do so by clicking on the icon.

Please note: If a photo is marked as private it can still be shared (if simultaenously highlighted) with supporting platforms (e.g. TerraMatch), and it will retain its private tag there as well.
