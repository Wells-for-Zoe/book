--> No, nothing happens.

--> No, nothing happens.


4. If any data is deleted in connected platforms (e.g. TerraMatch) that has been pushed via greenhouse., will this data be deleted in greenhouse.?

--> No, nothing happens.


5. If the geometry of a GPS-Polygon is updated after it has already been pushed to a connected platform (e.g. TerraMatch) - what happens?

--> Nothing happens, _unless_ the GPS-Polygon gets pushed to the respective connected platform again.


6. If the geometry of a GPS-Polygon was updated and then pushed _again_ to a site on the connected platform, what happens?
