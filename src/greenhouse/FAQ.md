1. If a GPS-photo, GPS-Polygon or a GPS-Centerpoint is deleted in greenhouse will it be automatically deleted in connected platforms (e.g. TerraMatch)?

    --> No, nothing happens.



2. If any data is deleted in connected platforms (e.g. TerraMatch) that has been pushed via greenhouse., will this data be deleted in greenhouse.?

    --> No, nothing happens.


3. If the geometry of a GPS-Polygon is updated in greenhouse after it has already been pushed to a connected platform (e.g. TerraMatch) - what happens?

    --> Nothing happens, _unless_ the GPS-Polygon gets pushed to the respective connected platform again.

4. If a geometry of a GPS-Polygon is updated in a connected platform (e.g. TerraMatch) that has originally been pushed to this platform from greenhouse, what happens?

    --> It is marked in greenhouse. as updated and it is from then on impossible to push it to the connected platform again in order not to create unwanted changes.

6. If the geometry of a GPS-Polygon was updated and then pushed _again_ to a site on the connected platform, what happens?

    --> The existing polygon at the connected platform (e.g. TerraMatch) will be updated
